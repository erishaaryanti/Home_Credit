# Home Credit Analysis

## Dataset
This data originally created by Home Credit (source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data). 

## Guide
We should build a classification model that can predict whether a client is capable enough to repay the loan or not. All script and explanation are all in the jupyter notebook file. Data preprocessing was done by doing some categorical and numerical aggregation. Dimensionality reduction was done by using collinearity removal and feature importance. The imbalanced dataset was handled by RandomSample Undersample and prediction was done by comparing the result between Random Forest Classifier, Adaboost Classifier, Gradient Boost Classifier with default parameter.
